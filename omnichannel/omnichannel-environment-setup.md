# Omnichannel Environment Setup

The RocketChat omnichannel feature provides a multi-channel environment for communication between companies and their customers.

## Requirements

Before you set up LiveChat, you are required to have the following installed on your device.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended instead of npm.

## Setting Up LiveChat

The Rocket.Chat LiveChat platform is developed with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). It is a minimal, lightweight application designed to facilitate B2C (Business-to-customer) communication between Agents and website visitors.

This setup is done assuming you have a Rocket.Chat server running. We will use a local instance at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for this guide.
{% endhint %}

To set up OmniChannel LiveChat,

* Clone the LiveChat source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/packages/livechat) by running this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git
```

* Navigate to the LiveChat folder in the cloned directory.

<pre><code>cd Rocket.Chat
<strong>cd packages/livechat
</strong></code></pre>

* Build preact application to `/build` folder after executing.

```
yarn dev
```

* In another terminal, run webpack with hot reload at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by executing this command:

```
yarn start
```

* Open up the `widget-demo.html` file in your browser: `http://localhost:8080/widget-demo.html`. You should see a page with the LiveChat initiation icon at the bottom right.
