# Developing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Rocket.Chat. If this is your first foray into the world of Open Source, we highly recommend GitHub's comprehensive guide, [Contributing to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Getting Started

You can find our projects [here](https://github.com/RocketChat). Go to the Issues tab, and when you find something you would like to work on, just comment on it, and we will add an [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress).

If you already have a work in progress pull request open for that issue, you can link that issue on your pull request or write `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER` where the `ISSUE_NUMBER` is the number at the end of the link URL.

Our projects can be found [here](https://github.com/RocketChat). Navigate to the **Issues** tab to find a project that interests you. Once you've found a suitable project, simply leave a comment and we'll add an [In Progress label ](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress)to it.

If you're already working on a pull request for that issue, you can link the issue to your pull request or use the format 'Closes #ISSUE\_NUMBER' where ISSUE\_NUMBER corresponds to the number at the end of the link URL.

**Assigned Issues:**

Sometimes you'll stumble upon issues that have an Assignee. Assignees are trusted people that are responsible for that issue (usually core team members).

But that doesn't mean you can't contribute! Every issue is open, and any help is welcome. Feel free to work on anything you want. You are encouraged to discuss your progress with the community in the comments, it doesn't mean other people can't work on it. Don't be discouraged from tackling something you feel like doing.

**Where to Find Tasks:**

Want a simple task to get you started? [We maintain a list of those](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)! Or search for issues tagged contrib:easy
