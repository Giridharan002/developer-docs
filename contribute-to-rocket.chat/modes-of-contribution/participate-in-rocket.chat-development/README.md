# Development

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to Rocket.Chat! Whether you're a seasoned open-source contributor or just starting out, your help is invaluable to us. If you're new to the open-source world, we recommend starting with [GitHub's comprehensive guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to familiarize yourself with the basics. And if it's your first time contributing to Rocket.Chat please go through our [code\_of\_conduct.md](../../code\_of\_conduct.md "mention") and [code-review-process.md](../../code-review-process.md "mention") .

**Getting Started**: Our projects are readily available for you to explore and contribute to. You can find them [here](https://github.com/RocketChat). Once you've found a project that piques your interest, navigate to the _Issues_ tab. If you come across an issue you'd like to work on, simply leave a comment. We'll mark you as _Assignee_ to the issue and add an [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress). If you're already working on a pull request for a particular issue, you can link the issue to your pull request. Alternatively, you can write `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER` in your comment, where the ISSUE\_NUMBER is the number at the end of the issue's URL.

**Assigned Issues:** You may notice that some issues already have an assignee. These are trusted individuals, often core team members, who are responsible for resolving the issue. However, this doesn't mean you can't contribute! All issues are open for contribution, and any help is greatly appreciated. We encourage you to work on any issue that interests you and share your progress with the community in the comments. Remember, multiple people can work on the same issue, so don't be discouraged from tackling an issue you're passionate about.

**Priority Features and Bug Fixes**: If there's a particular feature or bug fix with higher priority you'd like to sponsor develop via [BountySource](https://app.bountysource.com/teams/rocketchat), please [let us know](https://www.rocket.chat/contact).
