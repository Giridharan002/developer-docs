# Server

This brief overview introduces the Rocket.Chat Server, a core component of the larger Rocket.Chat Open Source Project ecosystem. As a secure and scalable communication platform, Rocket.Chat delivers robust features. In the interest of fostering a comprehensive understanding of the platform, the focus here will be on the server-side functionalities, which form the backbone of Rocket.Chat's extensive offering.

It is built using modern web technologies, including Node.js, MongoDB, and Meteor, and is designed to be scalable and secure, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes.

[Rocket.Chat clients](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/installing-client-apps) communicate with the server mainly through APIs and WebSocket connections, thus allowing for real-time communication and updates, providing a seamless experience for users.

Data is stored in MongoDB, and files are stored locally on the system running the server or over network services like Amazon S3. You can obtain a detailed view of all these components and understand how they interact in [architecture-and-components.md](../../getting-started/architecture-and-components.md "mention")

The Rocket.Chat Server is open source, highly customizable, and extensible, allowing developers to contribute and develop custom and new functionalities. Learn more about contributing here [participate-in-rocket.chat-development](../../contribute-to-rocket.chat/modes-of-contribution/participate-in-rocket.chat-development/ "mention").

It can be compiled and deployed on-premise or in the cloud, allowing organizations to choose the hosting environment that best meets their needs. Get more information about deployment [here](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/prepare-for-your-deployment).
