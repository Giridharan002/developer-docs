# Desktop Changing Default Settings

## Introduction

In changing the Desktop App default settings, we assume you have followed the guide on [..](../ "mention") and that you are familiar with the development stack which makes use of (_git, node. javascript, and electron_).

## Assets

Usually, the first thing you want to change are the icons. There are a few folders that you need to take note of. From your root project directory, assets can be changed or customized in the following directories.

```
./src/ui/icons/
./src/ui/assets/
```

Pay attention that these files are React components and you can change them correctly. When the changes are done, generate your new files by running...

```bash
yarn build-assets
```

## Tray Icon

If you want to customize the TrayIcon, there are two ways:

* Open `public/images/tray` there you can check all current icons used by the application. You can change files if you want.
* Open and change `ui/icon/AppIcon.tsx` this is the icon base used to automatically generate all the icons, if you are used with `tsx/jsx` probably this is the easiest way to go.

```
// change ui/icon/AppIcon.tsx and run
yarn build-assets
```

## About

To change the About screen, head on to `./src/ui/components/AboutDialog/index.tsx` where you can change the copyright. If you've changed the logo already, it will automatically reflect on this page.

```bash
const copyright = `Â© 2016-${new Date().getFullYear()}, Rocket.Chat`;
```

## Building and Packaging

We use [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to "compile" and produce the executable files, just check the file `electron-builder.json`

Here you should change all references to the term `rocket.chat/rocket/chat.rocket/rocketchat` according to what each setting means.

See the electron builder configuration page for more details not covered here.

After any change in configuration is made, bu sure to build a new release by running:

```bash
yarn build
yarn release
```
