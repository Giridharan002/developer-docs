# Repository Structure

This section is intended to familiarize you with the [Rocket.Chat repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) structure.

Rocket.Chat uses a [monorepo](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/wiki#fuselage-monorepo) to house several pieces of required code and packages needed by various Rocket.Chat projects like the [Apps Engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine), [LiveChat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Livechat), etc.

This makes it easier to maintain and share the code without duplicating it.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Rocket.Chat uses [Meteor framework](https://www.meteor.com/) and [React ](https://reactjs.org/)to build components. You should be familiar with those and their project structure([**Meteor project structure**](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html), [**React project structure**](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html)) to better understand Rocket.Chat repository structure.
* In the nearest future, the Rocket.Chat codebase is diverting from Meteor to a more manual structure.

#### **`apps/meteor/app/`**

Here you will find the various features available in Rocket.Chat. Each main folder under this directory has a **`client/`** and a **`server/`** subdirectories that hold the client and server-side code for that feature, respectively.\
In some cases, you will find the **`lib/`** directory, which contains code that can be used by both the server and client part of the app.\
Learn more from the [Meteor guide](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html).

{% hint style="success" %}
New features are being added to Rocket.Chat and will not follow this legacy meteor structure under the **`apps/`**folder. It will follow a different structure, but the code in the existing structure will still be maintained.
{% endhint %}

#### **`apps/meteor/client/views/`**

Where a combination of multiple components comes together in action to build a single Rocket.Chat page is seen by client-side users.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **`apps/meteor/client/views/`**is a very good starting point for beginners to see and trace code functionality
* The root view here can be seen in **`apps/meteor/client/views/root/AppRoot.tsx`** where execution in the front begins
{% endhint %}

#### **`apps/meteor/client/lib/`**

A collection of objects that are reused on all of the client sides.\
This is to:

* Limit code duplication
* Encourage contributors to use the code that is already existing in the codebase
* Avoid re-implementing logic or re-create functions

#### `apps/meteor/packages/`

Any meteor packages used within the project or customized for a specific purpose.\
Examples include the [meteor-accounts-linkedin](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/apps/meteor/packages/accounts-linkedin) for Linkedin login service, [rocketchat-i18n](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/apps/meteor/packages/rocketchat-i18n) for internationalization, etc

#### `apps/meteor/server/methods/`

Has meteor methods.

#### `apps/meteor/server/lib/`

Has general-purpose functions relating to server-side code.
