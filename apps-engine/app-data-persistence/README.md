# App Data Persistence

When developing applications, it is possible to enable data persistence on data object variables. By doing so, these variables are stored on the server and remain intact between sessions. Additionally, it is possible to choose whether to save data at the user or application level. This means that data can be saved for all users within the program. For example, if a comment text box is included in an application for users to provide feedback, the data entered into this box can be saved and remain persistent throughout the application.

Persisting app data can be done in two stages â€” managing the internal state and storing user inputs. Read the documents in the upcoming sections for more details on these topics.&#x20;
