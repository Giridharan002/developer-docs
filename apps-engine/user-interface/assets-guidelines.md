## App Icons

App icons create the first impression potential users get from your app. A well-designed icon can lead to more downloads by conveying the app's purpose and capturing usersâ€™ attention.

The app icon is displayed on:

1. App listing&#x20;
2. App detail
3. Rocket.Chat sidebar

Dimensions: 256x256px

### Guidelines

**Do** use a simple and recognizable design that conveys the app's purpose.\
**Do** follow the visual guides so the app icon can be read in different contexts.

**Don't** use a complicated or cluttered design that may be difficult to recognize or distinguish. \
**Don't** include the name of your app inside the app icon.

**Don't** use transparent backgrounds, as the app icon may not have enough contrast to be properly displayed on different themes of Rocket.Chat.

\
**Do** use the visual guides to center your logo within the frame manually.

**Don't** automatically center your logo within the frame; its shapes may require manual adjustments to optimize its optical balance.
