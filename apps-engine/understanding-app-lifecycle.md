# App Development Lifecycle

Application development is the process of planning, designing, developing, and putting the app to its intended use. This process typically follows the Application Development Life Cycle (ADLC). ADLC is a set of methodologies that facilitate app development. It guides developers to optimize the development project at every stage. The overall development cycle can vary based on the type of business, customers, and requirements.

The significant app development phases include:

* Discovery phase
* Design phase
* Development phase
* Quality assurance phase
* Release phase
* Maintenance phase

In addition, there are numerous methods for developing applications, including the waterfall method, rapid application development, agile, and DevOps methodologies. Depending on your organization's app development methodology, these steps may vary.

Additional Rocket.Chat-specific phases of the app development lifecycle include:

* App Logging
* App Deployment
* App Installation
* App Testing

## Rocket.Chat apps

Rocket.Chat apps are inherently distinct from what you may be accustomed to on other platforms as they operate within a Rocket.Chat server. This allows the users to retain all their data within their own structure, as the server is not required to send data to an externally hosted service that provides additional functionality.

To add an app to a Rocket.Chat workspace, you must either download it from our [Marketplace](http://marketplace.rocket.chat) or manually [upload it to the server](https://docs.rocket.chat/extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace). Once an app is introduced to Rocket.Chat, it goes through several phases. In the next section, we will learn about the app lifecycle states in a Rocket.Chat server.
