# Introduction to Apps Engine

Today’s businesses must innovate to maximize efficiencies and continue to seek out new methods to expand without escalating expenses. They need to make the most of their time, money, and resources because of significant changes in the economy and more people wanting apps, and a lack of skilled app writers. Consequently, IT backlogs are growing, and because IT cannot keep up, shadow IT is widespread. This leads to a lot of uncontrolled, separate apps that raise risk, add to technology debt, and make employees less productive and less happy.

This is where Apps Engine comes in handy because it makes standard app creation easier while speeding up delivery. Developers can use Apps Engine's low-code tools and pre-built components to focus on making high-value apps instead of rebuilding application infrastructure and current features.

### What is Apps Engine?&#x20;

Apps Engine is a platform that enables developers to develop and run applications on Rocket.Chat’s infrastructure. It provides a framework and APIs for the apps you develop to interact with Rocket.Chat, thereby allowing a tighter incoming/outgoing integration with Rocket.Chat. Apps Engine enables developers to develop extensions to Rocket.Chat and add functionalities without having to dive deep into the base code – which is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. With security, scalability, and high-performance modules built-in, Apps Engine is a popular choice for developers who want to develop low-code apps and accelerate the time to market.

### What are the benefits of Apps Engine?&#x20;

* **Enterprise-level security and reporting infrastructure:** Since Rocket.Chat operates and manages Apps Engine, it benefits from the highest levels of data privacy, security, and ownership standards. Our software has been deployed in the most rigorous environments, ensuring compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, FINRA, FedRAMP, and other regulations. Rocket.Chat is verified as secure for use under the United States Department of Defense’s Platform One DevSecOps initiative. In addition to the robust security features, Apps Engine has extensive reporting tools that can be used to monitor the efficacy of your app and identify potential problems. For instance, if there is a bug in your code, you can use the Apps Engine logs to swiftly locate and resolve the issue.
* **Scalable and simple to use:** As your business expands and your app gains more users, it is essential to have a platform that can readily scale to meet the growing needs and demands of your business. With Apps Engine, you can add additional resources as necessary without reconfiguring your entire infrastructure. The Rocket.Chat App Engine includes the tools required to create, test, launch, and update applications. This can save a substantial amount of time and effort as your business expands.
* **Support for app versioning:** Additionally, you can host different app versions and set up development, test, staging, and production environments with relative ease. Rocket.Chat's Apps Engine is compatible with common development tools like Eclipse and Git.
* **Utilizes Rocket.Chat servers to run the platform:** By utilizing some of the hardware that Rocket.Chat utilizes for its own applications, businesses can be confident that their applications can manage any amount of traffic or demand. In addition, because Rocket.Chat operates and manages Apps Engine, developers can rely on having access to the most recent features and enhancements. Additionally, the application can be created using language runtimes such as JavaScript.
* **Ensure faster time to market:** The speedy introduction of a product or service to the market is crucial for all businesses. Promoting the development and maintenance of an app is essential for accelerating its availability. The only requirement for developers using Rocket.Chat Apps Engine is to write code. With zero configuration and server administration, you eliminate all the burdens of administering and deploying the code. The tool repository and other functionalities reduce the time required for app development and testing, thereby accelerating the introduction of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and subsequent products. The Apps Engine features save you a significant amount of time and effort compared to developing your own apps from inception.
* **A diverse set of native APIs:** A number of Apps Engine's built-in APIs can be used to add features and functionality to an application. Several APIs and services are included with Rocket.Chat Apps Engine, allowing you to create robust and feature-rich applications.
