# Introduction to Apps-Engine

In today's evolving economy, businesses are pressed to innovate while also managing costs. The high demand for apps and a shortage of skilled developers have led to the growth of technological backlogs and shadow IT, which adds risk and inefficiency. Rocket.Chat's Apps-Engine offers a solution by simplifying app development and speeding up the delivery process, thereby optimizing resources.

Apps-Engine enables developers to build and run applications on Rocket.Chat's infrastructure using pre-built components. It provides a framework and APIs for you to develop secure and scalable apps that interact with Rocket.Chat. With this, you can create extensions and add functionalities without diving deep into the base code.

### Features of Apps-Engine

* **Security -** Rocket.Chat complies with GDPR, HIPAA, FINRA, FedRAMP, and other regulations. Rocket.Chat is also verified as secure for use under the United States Department of Defenseâ€™s Platform One DevSecOps initiative. Since Rocket.Chat operates and manages Apps-Engine, it ensures data privacy, security, and ownership standards for the apps you create.
* **Reporting infrastructure -** Apps-Engine has reporting tools that you can use to monitor the efficiency of your app and identify potential problems. For example, if there is a bug in your code, you can use the Apps-Engine logs to locate and resolve the issue.
* **Rocket.Chat servers to run the platform -** Since Apps-Engine uses the same infrastructure that Rocket.Chat is running on, the apps that you create can manage traffic effectively. Developers have access to the recent features and enhancements. In addition, the apps run in JavaScript runtime.
* **Reduce launch time -** Using Apps-Engine, developers only need to write code. Deployment of code, configuration, or server administration is not required. The Apps-Engine repository and other functionalities reduce the time required for app development and testing, thereby accelerating the introduction of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and subsequent products.
* **Native APIs -** Several APIs and services are included in Apps-Engine which you can use to add features to your apps.
