# App Lifecycle

Rocket.Chat Apps are inherently distinct from what you may be accustomed to on other platforms, as they operate within a Rocket.Chat server. This allows Rocket.Chat users retain all of their data within their own structure, as the server is no longer required to send data to an externally hosted service that provides additional functionality.

For an App to be added to a Rocket.Chat workspace, it must either be downloaded from our [Marketplace](http://marketplace.rocket.chat) or manually uploaded to the server. Once something is introduced to Rocket.Chat, it moves through several phases. In the following sections, we will elaborate on each phase and delve more deeply into the Rocket.Chat-specific phases. We will also discuss an application's lifecycle methods while it is running inside Rocket.Chat server.&#x20;
