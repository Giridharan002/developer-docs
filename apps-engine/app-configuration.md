# App Configuration

It consists primarily of providing settings that the Apps Engine will then present on the administration interface for the workspace administrator to configure and launch the application.&#x20;

Everything under the **Settings** menu of the app within a marketplace belongs under the **App Configuration** section. This tab contains various fields and instructions that can be filled out. What you see on this screen must be configured for the application, and that's what this section is about.&#x20;

Here are some key terms you need familiarize yourself with:&#x20;

* ID - for identifying the settings
* Type - the type of the value that will be saved
* Required - whether or not configuring the application is required
* Package value - the default value before the administrator can configure anything
* I18n label - the translated name or description of an application&#x20;

\
There is a distinct file containing the configuration settings, in which everything is defined as a basic object. In this file, each setting is defined separately. In the `extendConfiguration` method, you simply read the file, and for each setting, it calls the `provideSetting` method, so that each setting that is defined is read, called, and displayed in the user interface.&#x20;

This is equivalent to executing the command:&#x20;

```
configuration.settings.provideSetting ({

Define all the parameters of your setting

} )
```

Since your app may have multiple settings, it is preferable to organize them all in a separate file and reference them as required in the app's main file.&#x20;

Here are the various categories of configurations that Rocket.Chat supports. Each of these will appear differently within the **Settings** tab of the app in the marketplace.&#x20;

* Boolean
* Code
* Color
* Font
* Number
* Select
* String
* Multi-select

The `onSettingUpdated` method will be invoked each time the administrator modifies the application's configuration via the **Settings** panel. The method will use the new value to make adjustments as necessary. You can use this, for instance, to inform an external service that the parameters have changed and the values have been updated. In the case of `onPreSettingUpdate`, you will receive both the old and updated settings values. The App Lifecycle document explains the various methods and their corresponding statuses in greater detail.&#x20;

It is common in integrations to want to always transmit certain security protocols for API requests. In the case of the Rocket.Chat REST API, these headers are X-Auth-Token and X-User-Id. Therefore, it would be desirable if these headers were always set when making API queries. In such situations, it is customary to generate a personal access token in Rocket.Chat. Read the [Access Tokens Endpoint documentation](https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api/endpoints/other-important-endpoints/access-tokens-endpoints) for more information. In such cases, it makes sense to add configuration parameters to the application. These are configured in the `extendConfiguration` method of the application's primary class.&#x20;

The **client ID** and **client secret** are routinely generated by one of the mechanisms for the app settings. Client ID and client secret would almost always be required by apps. Therefore, Rocket.Chat has supplied a code template that developers can utilize without having to code it themselves.
