# Monorepo

The term _Fuselage_ has three distinct meanings in Rocket.Chat:

* The [design system](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) for all Rocket.Chat projects
* The set of components and assets that make up the design system
* The name of the [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains all of the above and other related resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
To avoid confusion, we will use the term "_Fuselage Monorepo_" to specifically refer to the monorepository containing all Fuselage-related components, assets, and additional elements within Rocket.Chat.

### Why a monorepo?

From inception, Rocket.Chat adopted a strategy of splitting the codebase into multiple packages, similar to the Meteor community's approach. This segmentation was implemented to organize the codebase according to specific features, enabling a more targeted approach to development. It proved particularly effective in addressing issues arising from stagnant dependencies that lacked updates.

\
Initially, the _Fuselage Monorepo_ aimed to bridge the void left by old packages, while introducing a separate design system implementation. Its success is evident through the repository's diverse contents, extending beyond components and assets to encompass a wide array of packages beneficial for front-end development.
